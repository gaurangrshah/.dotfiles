# This script will download the contents of a GitHub repo
# and place them in a local directory.
#
# Usage:
#   download-repo.sh <repo> <output-path> <nested-path>
#
# Example:
#   download-repo.sh wattenberger/kumiko ./kumiko-assets
# public/assets
#
# You'll get rate-limited by GitHub, so create a PAT here:
#   https://github.com/settings/tokens
# This will also let you download from private repos.
